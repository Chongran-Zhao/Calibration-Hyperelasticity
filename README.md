# Calibration-Hyperelasticity
A Python framework for calibrating hyperelastic models (Neo-Hookean, AB, Ogden, etc.). It features simultaneous fitting of multi-loading experimental data (UT, ET, PS) using SciPy optimization. Built for modularity and research, it implements phenomenological and micromechanical constitutive laws with high-fidelity visualization.
